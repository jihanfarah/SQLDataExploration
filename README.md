# SQLDataExploration

## Description
This project based on [Alex Freberg's SQL Data Exploration Tutorial on Youtube](https://youtu.be/qfyynHBFOsM). I use Microsoft SQL Server to do this project and get the dataset from [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). There are some exploration I did in this project, such as:

1. Total Case vs Total Deaths
2. Total Case vs Total Population
3. Countries with highest infection rate compared to population
4. Countries with the highest death count per population
5. Continents with the highest death count per population
6. Global numbers of COVID's Cases
7. Total Population vs Vaccination
8. Create View for further visualization
